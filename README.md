# Easy User Authentication for React Apps (Sample with Classes)

This repository hosts a React project that defines a Single-Page Application (SPA). You'll secure access to some of its routes using Auth0 User Authentication.

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the client project:

```bash
npm start
```

The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.

Visit [`http://localhost:4040/`](http://localhost:4040/) to access the application.

## Get Started with Auth0

### Sign up and create an Auth0 Application

If you haven't already, <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">**sign up for a free Auth0 account**</a>.

Once you sign in, Auth0 takes you to the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/). In the left sidebar menu, click on ["Applications"](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).

Then, click the "Create Application" button. A modal opens up with a form to provide a name for the application and choose its type.

- **Name:** Auth0 React Sample

- **Application Type:** Single Page Web Applications

Click the "Create" button to complete the process. Your Auth0 application page loads up.

Click on the "Settings" tab of your Auth0 Application page and fill in the following values:

ðŸ›  **Allowed Callback URL**

```bash
http://localhost:4040
```

The above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users **after they successfully log in**.

ðŸ›  **Allowed Logout URL**

```bash
http://localhost:4040
```

The above value is the URL that Auth0 can use to redirect your users **after they log out**.

ðŸ›  **Allowed Web Origins**

```bash
http://localhost:4040
```

Using the Auth0 React SDK, your React application will make requests under the hood to an Auth0 URL to handle authentication requests. As such, you need to add your React application [origin URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) to avoid [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://auth0.com/blog/cors-tutorial-a-guide-to-cross-origin-resource-sharing/) issues.

**Scroll down and click the "Save Changes" button.**

**Do not close this page yet**. You'll need some of its information in the next section.

### Add the Auth0 configuration variables to React

From the Auth0 Application Settings page, you need the Auth0 Domain and Client ID values to allow your React application to use the communication bridge you created. 

Open the React starter project, `auth0-react-sample-classes`, and create a `.env` file under the project directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Populate `.env` as follows:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://express.sample
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6060
```

The value of `REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN` is the "Domain" value from the "Settings".

The value of `REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` is the "Client ID" value from the "Settings".

![Auth0 Application Settings from the Auth0 Dashboard](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-authentication-with-auth0/auth0-application-settings-for-react-sdk.png)

These variables let your React application identify itself as an authorized party to interact with the Auth0 authentication server.

## Get the Express API demo

You need this Express server to test making secure API calls from the React application sample.

Open a new terminal window and clone the `auth0-express-js-sample` repo somewhere in your system.  **Ensure that you clone it outside of your React project directory**.
 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:auth0-blog/auth0-express-js-sample.git
```

Once you clone this repo, **make the `auth0-express-js-sample` directory your current directory**:

```bash
cd auth0-express-js-sample
```

Install the Node.js project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Connect the Express API with Auth0

This process is similar to how you connected React with Auth0.
 
Head to the [APIs section in the Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis), and click the "Create API" button.

Then, in the form that Auth0 shows:
 
- Add a **Name** to your API: Auth0 Express Sample

- Set its **Identifier** value: https://express.sample

- Leave the signing algorithm as `RS256` as it's the best option from a security standpoint.

The **Identifier** is the same as the `REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` value in the `.env` file from your React application.

![Auth0 Dashboard new API form](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/developing-a-secure-api-with-nestjs/auth0-dashboard-new-api-form.png)

With these values in place, hit the "Create" button.

Now, click on the "Quick Start" tab of your Auth0 API page. This page presents instructions on how to set up different APIs. From the code box, choose "Node.js". Keep this page open as you'll be using the values next.

![Auth0 API Node.js Quickstart](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-authentication-with-auth0/auth0-api-node-js-quickstart.png)

Create a `.env` file for the API Server under the `auth0-express-sample` directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Populate this `auth0-express-sample/.env` file as follows:

```bash
SERVER_PORT=6060
CLIENT_ORIGIN_URL=http://localhost:4040
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
AUTH0_ISSUER_URL=
```

Head back to the "Node.js" code snippet from the Auth0 API "Quick Start" page. Locate the definition of `jwtCheck`:

```javascript
var jwtCheck = jwt({
  secret: jwks.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: "https://<TENANT-NAME>.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
  }),
  audience: "https://express.sample", // ðŸ‘ˆ AUTH0_AUDIENCE value
  issuer: "https://<TENANT-NAME>.auth0.com/", // ðŸ‘ˆ AUTH0_ISSUER_URL value
  algorithms: ["RS256"],
});
```

Look at the object that the `jwt` function takes as an argument and use the following properties to complete the values of your `.env` file:

The `audience` property is the value of `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`.

The `issuer` property is the value of `AUTH0_ISSUER_URL`.

### Run the Express server

With the `.env` configuration values set, run the API server by issuing the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
